Automatically shortens the blog post URL.

== Description ==

With this Plugin you optimize your workflow as it enables you to auto-generate a shortened URL to your blog posts and stores it in the database. And the URL is displayed below the blog post. If the permalink of the article changes, a new Short URL will be automatically generated.
These Short URLs are particular useful for twitter and alike as these services limit the messages of their users to a certain amount of characters - which leads to the situation that their users are forced to have an eye on what exactly they want to write.
And by providing a very short URL it's easier for them to spread the word on your blog article as they have more characters left for personal remarks.  Of course this will help promote your blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `post-address-shortening` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. When you post a new article, the plugin will automatically generate a short URL.
